    Semantic HTML jsut defines the different parts of the webpage.

    2. What is HTML used for?

    4. What is the h1 tag used for? How many times should I use it on a page?
    The H1 tag is used for defining the main heading on the webpage. There should be only one H1 because there's only one main objective on the webpage.

    5. Name two tags that have required attributes
    One tag would be <img src="" alt=""> or the alt tag for screen readers, etc.
    Another tag would be <p title=""></p> or a tooltip used when hovering over text such as a paragraph.

    6. What do we put in the head of our HTML document?
    The head of the html document holds specific data for that document. This is pretty much what goes in the head when making a new html document:
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">

        <title>Document</title>
    </head>

    An id is similar to a class except it can only identify one element while class can define multiple.

    8. What elements can I add an id to?
    An id can be added to any element in the document.

    9. How many times can I use the same id on a page?

    10. What is a class?
    A class attribute can identify many elements in the html document.

    12. How many times can I use the same class on a page?
    Good practice would say only to use the class attribute for one part of the code at a time. Just make another class for the other elements lol.
